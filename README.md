# Dockerfiles

This repository holds stand-alone `Dockerfile`s for tasks or other projects that do not have `Dockerfile`s or containers pre-built.

## Quickstart

```
docker build https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnovack/dockerfiles/master/PROJECT/Dockerfile
```

Naturally, you can add your `--BUILD_ARGS` and `--tag` as appropriate.
